# BOMCreatorCounter

A small script I wrote with the help of ChatGPT 3.5 to count the similar instances in length, width and thickness of different components from the output of [Kevin Ramsay's BOM Creator](https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Detail/Index?id=1777906377548870264&appLang=en&os=Mac) add on for fusion 360.

The script wil give as output the filename with _result added to it in the same folder where you run the script.

Enjoy!
